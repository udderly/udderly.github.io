                <h1>Who we are</h1>
                <p>
                    Gunn Aero is a Gunn High School club dedicated to designing, building, and flying rockets! We participate in the yearly Team America Rocket Competition, or TARC, a national competition for model rocketeers. Meetings are held every Saturday 3-5 at MakeX in Cubberley Community Center.
                    <br><br>
                    This year, we are building a rocket that goes to 800 ft and lands safely in one piece with one intact raw egg in 40 to 43 seconds. It is built out of cardboard tubing, laser-cut wood, polyethylene foam, and a computer-controlled mechanism that releases the parachutes.
                    <br><br>
                    We use advanced custom mechanisms embedded in the rocket and controlled by computer code to precisely eject the parachute from the rocket at the right height. This requires the use of a custom-made electronic board made specially for our rocket.

                    <h1>About TARC</h1>
                    <p>
                        TARC is an annual national competition (that then allows moving on to an international competition) organized by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and the National Association of Rocketry (NAR). It was initially a one time event in 2006 to celebrate the centennial of heavier-than-air human flight and returned the next year due to popular demand. It is now an annual international event with teams from the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, England, and Germany, with national fly-offs of the top ten teams held in Washington D.C., and international fly-offs of the top team from each participating country held in the Paris Air Show and Farnborough Airshow on an alternating basis.
                        <br><br>
                        This years rules are the launching of one egg to 800 ft (244 m), with a time of 40 to 43 seconds from motor ignition to touchdown, with points added for how far off target each flight was. The goal is to obtain the lowest score.
