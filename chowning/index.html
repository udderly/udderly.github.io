                    <p>Utilizing the Bel Canto technique, students learn to sing with less strain to their vocal folds and develop healthy singing habits. The benefits are enourmous.<br><br>As students progress, they gain confidence and develop artistic refinement for a lifetime of singing pleasure and performance skills. Children who begin with the Bel Canto method, rather than singing pop style, particularly benefit and avoid permanently damaging their young, growing voices.</p>

                    <p id="drop-text"><br>As far as is known, the art and science of vocal pedagogy began in the Catholic Churches of Spain in the 14th century, spread to Italy, and evolved by the early 17th century into a style of singing known as “Bel Canto”.<br><br>It is not commonly known that Bel Canto, “beautiful singing”, is a very specific vocal technique. Schools were dedicated to developing the Bel Canto technique carried out by master vocal teachers, while many of whom often maintained successful composing and singing careers.<br><br>These early teachers were as interested in the study of voice production, the vocal apparatus and its natural physical behavior as they were in music and artful singing. They wrote their findings in treatises, which found their way to the libraries throughout Europe.<br><br>With the use of computers and other advanced research tools, researchers are discovering that a surprisingly large amount of the Bel Canto theory is supported by contemporary science.<br><br>I believe in the importance of such ongoing research to vocal teaching, as it informs and guides the development and application of Bel Canto technique today and its ultimate benefit for all my students.</p>
