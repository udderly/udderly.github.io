                    <p>Utilizing the Bel Canto technique, students learn to sing with less strain to their vocal folds and develop healthy singing habits. The benefits are enourmous.<br><br>As students progress, they gain confidence and develop artistic refinement for a lifetime of singing pleasure and performance skills. Children who begin with the Bel Canto method, rather than singing pop style, particularly benefit and avoid permanently damaging their young, growing voices.</p>
