                    <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
                        Unsworth joins at an incredible time for the quartet. Quadre was awarded the 2020 Heart Prize by the Ariel Avant organization in recognition of its artistic programming tied to social justice issues. The genesis of this life-changing artistic work came within the first two years of Quadre&rsquo;s inception in 1998 when the quartet was selected for a year-long rural residency program in Selma, Alabama sponsored by Chamber Music America.

                        For the 2021&ndash;2022 season, Quadre will present <em>Nature: Calls for Harmony</em>, which includes collaboration with local agencies to highlight the incredible work being done to address a host of environmental issues in our community. Visual artists and poets will partner with the ensemble and a work for horn quartet, piano and gospel choir has been commissioned from Jeff Scott, horn player with Imani Winds and professor of horn at Oberlin Conservatory of Music.
