                    <p>
                        Quadre offers a variety of education activities in conjunction with our concert presentations. Masterclasses, outreach concerts, reading sessions and horn days are designed to bring the community together for a rich artistic experience.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Masterclass</span><br>
                        Quadre masterclasses offer a wealth of benefits to both performers and audience members. Through an iterative process, a small, pre-selected group of students perform in front of an audience and are given technical suggestions and interpretative feedback. By the end of the masterclass, students gain confidence and are inspired to delve deeper on their own. All attendees leave with a greater appreciation of the musical creation process.

                        Committed to promoting music education in schools, Quadre excites the imaginations of kindergarteners to college students with interactive and fun programs. &ldquo;Toot Your Own Horn&rdquo; introduces students to classical chamber music in an accessible way. Through lively performance, story-telling, humor and instruction, Quadre engages the minds of students, who learn new critical thinking and creative skills as well as develop greater musical appreciation.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Reading Sessions</span><br>
                        In a small group environment, Quadre performs the works of new composers, including those by Quadre, in live reading sessions. Students will be asked to give feedback and have the chance to perform alongside Quadre. A key highlight for students is the chance to discuss their interpretation of the music with actual composers. This is an exciting way for attendees to participate and engage in a musical experience.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Horn Days</span><br>
                        Quadre-hosted Horn Days galvanize local horn communities by bringing together adult amateurs as well as students from local middle and high schools in a one or two-day program-filled event. Horn players connect, bond and participate in workshops such as mock auditions, masterclasses, musicianship, improvisation, practicing techniques and performance. In the final evening, students perform for the local community and as a grand finale, participate in what many students have called an &ldquo;epic&rdquo; horn choir.

                        We strive to serve the communities where we live and are dedicated to engagement with the community.

                        As our universal culture becomes more rich and diverse, we have made our presentations reflect the attitudes and desires of our listeners. Quadre believes that the creation and promotion of new music nurtures composers and opens the minds of young performers to new music that is essential to this cause. As we collaborate with artists of all disciplines, the synthesis of joint programs and presentations can add diversity to our own artistic expression and create new avenues to explore, which are vital to the artistic process.

                &ldquo;Their attention to details of balance, ensemble and intonation is exemplary&hellip; Let's hope they are able to make a visit to the UK soon.&rdquo; (British Horn Player magazine)

                &ldquo;The French horn is like the Merlot grape. Vintners know to throw in some Merlot to rescue a harsh Cabernet, and composers use the mellow, velvety tones of the French horn to create a blended orchestra sound. But the Merlot grape also makes fine wine in its own right. Enter the French horn quartet, QUADRE.&rdquo; (Mountain View Voice)

                &ldquo;Zaps the myth that classical stuff&rsquo;s stuffy.&rdquo; (Birmingham News)
