            <h1>New Works</h1>
            <p>
                Quadre is fortunate to have two resident composers that are members of the ensemble. They allow us to perform works that truly express what we want to say. Daniel and Adam have written about personal experiences of loss, love, resilience, pain, triumph and joy. Many of their works convey the difficulties of finding meaning amidst uncertainty, but they also offer musical expressions of hope and purpose.
                <br><br>
                As an ensemble, we feel strongly that commissioning traditionally underserved composers is vital to the future of our field. We are deeply troubled by the elitism we have seen in our industry and feel it is paramount to address these social and economic injustice issues. In our small way, we feel we can start to &ldquo;right the ship&rdquo; by exclusively commissioning underserved composers that push the boundaries of our genre.
                <br><br>
                To this end, we feel privileged and honored to commission Nina Shekhar for Quadre&rsquo;s 2020&ndash;2021 season, <em>Homelessness: Hope, Humanity and Heart</em>. In collaboration with Ben Shirley, an unhoused artist in Los Angeles, the work delves into what &ldquo;home&rdquo; means to all the artists and our community.
                <br><br>
                Beyond commissioning, Quadre&rsquo;s annual composition competition is another way Quadre brings contemporary classical composers to the stage. In 2020, 69 composers from 14 countries submitted works. Michael Kaulkin won first place with his work, &ldquo;By Hook or By Crook&rdquo; and Zachary McDonald won second place with his work, &ldquo;Locked Up.&rdquo; Both works will be performed this season. For more details about the 2021 competition, go to the <a href="../projects/?p=competition">Projects page</a>.

                    <h1>Education</h1>
                    <p>
                        Quadre offers a variety of education activities in conjunction with our concert presentations. Masterclasses, outreach concerts, reading sessions and horn days are designed to bring the community together for a rich artistic experience.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Masterclass</span><br>
                        Quadre masterclasses offer a wealth of benefits to both performers and audience members. Through an iterative process, a small, pre-selected group of students perform in front of an audience and are given technical suggestions and interpretative feedback. By the end of the masterclass, students gain confidence and are inspired to delve deeper on their own. All attendees leave with a greater appreciation of the musical creation process.  
                        <br><br>
                        Equally comfortable working in the virtual sphere, Quadre also offers online masterclasses called &ldquo;Bite-sized Sessions&rdquo; where participants hear from our artists and then move to small group breakout rooms based on their experience for more individual advice and comments. Topics include practice techniques, breathing exercises to build efficiency, improvisation, and warmups/routines.
                    </p>

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Outreach Concerts</span><br>
                        Committed to promoting music education in schools, Quadre excites the imaginations of kindergarteners to college students with interactive and fun programs. &ldquo;Toot Your Own Horn&rdquo; introduces students to classical chamber music in an accessible way. Through lively performance, story-telling, humor and instruction, Quadre engages the minds of students, who learn new critical thinking and creative skills as well as develop greater musical appreciation.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Reading Sessions</span><br>
                        In a small group environment, Quadre performs the works of new composers, including those by Quadre, in live reading sessions. Students will be asked to give feedback and have the chance to perform alongside Quadre. A key highlight for students is the chance to discuss their interpretation of the music with actual composers. This is an exciting way for attendees to participate and engage in a musical experience.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px">Horn Days</span><br>
                        Quadre-hosted Horn Days galvanize local horn communities by bringing together adult amateurs as well as students from local middle and high schools in a one or two-day program-filled event. Horn players connect, bond and participate in workshops such as mock auditions, masterclasses, musicianship, improvisation, practicing techniques and performance. In the final evening, students perform for the local community and as a grand finale, participate in what many students have called an &ldquo;epic&rdquo; horn choir.

                    <p style="padding-bottom: 50px">
                        We strive to serve the communities where we live and are dedicated to engagement with the community. We recognize that this need exists throughout the nation and seek to serve every community we visit in the same manner. The purpose of our engagement is to reach out to underserved populations and the community at large. Venues for such events include, but are not limited to: Title IV schools, hospitals, eldercare facilities, hospices, homes for troubled youth, prisons, shopping centers, train stations, downtown areas and sporting venues.
                        <br><br>
                        As our universal culture becomes more rich and diverse, we have made our presentations reflect the attitudes and desires of our listeners. Quadre believes that the creation and promotion of new music nurtures composers and opens the minds of young performers to new music that is essential to this cause. As we collaborate with artists of all disciplines, the synthesis of joint programs and presentations can add diversity to our own artistic expression and create new avenues to explore, which are vital to the artistic process.
