            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>Masterclass</h3>
            <p>
                A Quadre masterclass offer a wealth of benefits to both performers and audience members. Through an iterative process, a small, pre-selected group of students perform in front of an audience and are given technical suggestions and interpretative feedback.  By the end of the masterclass, students gain confidence and are inspired to delve deeper on their own. All attendees leave with a greater appreciation of the musical creation process.
            </p>
            <h3>Outreach Concerts</h3>
            <p>
                Committed to promoting music education in schools, Quadre excites the imaginations of kindergarteners to college students with interactive and fun programs. “Toot Your Own Horn”  introduces students to classical chamber music in an accessible way. Through lively performance, story-telling, humor and instruction, Quadre engages the minds of students, who learn new critical thinking and creative skills as well as develop greater musical appreciation.
            </p>
            <h3>Horn Sessions</h3>
            <p>
                Quadre-hosted Horn Sessions galvanizes local horn communities by bringing together students from local middle and high schools in a two-day program-filled event. Students connect, bond and participate in workshops such as mock auditions, musicianship, improvisation, practicing techniques and performance. Acclaimed guest hornists lead masterclasses.  In the final evening, students perform for the local community and as a grand finale, participate in what many students have called an “epic” horn choir.
            </p>
            <h3>Reading Days</h3>
            <p>
                In a small group environment, Quadre performs the works of new composers, including those by Quadre, in live reading sessions.  Student hornists will be asked to give feedback and have the chance to perform alongside Quadre. A key highlight for students is the chance to discuss their interpretation of the music with actual composers. This is an exciting way for attendees to participate and engage in a musical experience.
