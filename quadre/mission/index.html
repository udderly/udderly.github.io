            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                Quadre&rsquo;s core mission to make music more accessible extends far beyond the concert hall. Equally at home in K-12 classrooms and colleges or universities, our interactive interdisciplinary outreach activities have reached over 50,000 people across the United States. Quadre&rsquo;s nationwide education residencies in urban and rural environments have been supported by funding from prominent organizations including, The National Endowment for the Arts, Chamber Music America, The San Francisco Symphony and The Arts Council of Silicon Valley.
                <br><br>
                Any aspect of the following educational initiatives can be combined to create a unique multi-day residency in your community or school.

                    <p style="padding-bottom: 50px">
                        We strive to serve the communities where we live and are dedicated to engagement with the community. We recognize that this need exists throughout the nation and seek to serve every community we visit in the same manner. The purpose of our engagement is to reach out to underserved populations and the community at large. Venues for such events inclue, but are not limited to: Title IV schools, hospitals, eldercare facilities, hospices, homes for troubled youth, prisons, shopping ceners, train stations, downtown areas and sporting venues.
                        <br><br>
                        As our universal culture becomes more rich and diverse, we strive to make our presentations reflect the attitudes and desires of our listeners. Quadre believes that the creation and promotion of new music nurtures composers and opens the minds of young performers to new music that is essential to this cause. As we collaborate with artists of all disciplines, the synthesis of joint programs and presentations can add diversity to our own artistic expression and create new avenues to explore, which are vital to the artistic process.
