                Dear Music Lover,
                <br><br>
                For more than 20 years, donors have been the lifeblood of Quadre, as we teach, perform, provide outreach, and compose. Our home base is the San Francisco Bay Area, making forays around the country for performance tours.
                <br><br>
                Challenges facing music educators and performers mount, as we compete for limited resources. You allow us to work in K&ndash;12 music programs, touching the talents and sparking musical interest and appreciation in the upcoming generation. You support us to perform locally, as well as around the country, keeping alive the respected tradition of chamber music. We need your backing to carry forward.
                <br><br>
                The arts are a positive reflection of the community at large: the way to keep the arts alive is through community support. Quadre relies on your generosity.
                <br><br>
                All donations are tax deductible; Quadre is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. You make our contributions to the musical enrichment of our immediate community possible, and you permit us to expand beyond!
            </p>
