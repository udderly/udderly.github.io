                        Quadre&rsquo;s Music with a Message project shines a spotlight on issues that concern all of us today. Through new commissions by local and international composers, the ensemble partners with local 501(c)(3) nonprofit social organizations and collaborates with professors at Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley.
                        <br><br>
                        Since Quadre&rsquo;s beginnings in the &rsquo;90s, the group has sought out ways to connect with the community at civic functions, youth and senior centers, and schools. This spirit has guided the group over the years towards a greater emphasis on social issues.
                        <br><br>
                        The Music with a Message project provides Quadre a platform to serve as a catalyst and vehicle for social change. Our duty as interpreters of society&rsquo;s consciousness is to create programs for our audiences that engender discussion and action on issues such as homelessness; climate change and the environment; social, gender and racial inequality; and over-consumption.
                        <br><br>
                        For the 2020&ndash;2021 season, Quadre will be working with a local homeless shelter, food pantry, youth center, women&rsquo;s advocacy group, school for the deaf, prison, and low-cost housing facility around these issues.
