                        Quadre&rsquo;s Music with a Message project shines a spotlight on issues that concern all of us today. Through new commissions by local and international composers, the ensemble partners with local 501(c)(3) nonprofit social organizations and collaborates with regionally recognized visual artists and poets.
                        <br><br>
                        Since Quadre&rsquo;s beginnings in the &rsquo;90s, the group has sought out ways to connect with the community at civic functions, youth and senior centers, and schools. This spirit has guided the group over the years towards a greater emphasis on community issues.
                        <br><br>
                        The Music with a Message project provides Quadre a platform to serve as a catalyst and vehicle for social change. Our duty as interpreters of society&rsquo;s consciousness is to create programs for our audiences that engender discussion and action on issues such as homelessness; gender and racial inequality; and the environment.
                        <br><br>
                        For the 2021&ndash;2022 season, Quadre is presenting <em>Nature: Calls for Harmony</em> which includes collaboration with local agencies to highlight the incredible work being done to address a host of environmental issues in our community. At the same time, Quadre will continue its work from the previous season, <em>Homelessness: Hope, Humanity and Heart</em> working with the clients served by local homeless shelters, food pantries, and low-cost housing facilities.
