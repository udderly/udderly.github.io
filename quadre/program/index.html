            <h1>Program Notes</h1>
            <p>
                &ldquo;What is Home?&rdquo; is a Quadre musical production that focuses on the issues and uplifting work being done in the unhoused community. Over many years of touring, we&rsquo;ve had the privilege and honor to perform at local organizations that serve the unhoused community and through these performances, we&rsquo;ve had the chance to meet members and leaders who have informed, inspired and changed us.
                <br><br>
				For this concert, Quadre commissioned nationally acclaimed composers Nina Shekhar and Benjamin Shirley to create two stunning companion pieces, &ldquo;Recovery Swap&rdquo; and &ldquo;Steglitz&rdquo; both set for horn quartet and electronics. Ben&rsquo;s perspective was particularly meaningful for this program as he spent 26 months living at the Midnight Mission, a homeless shelter in Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. The two pieces work in tandem to musically explore the relationship between our identities and sense of home.
                <br><br>
                In Daniel Wood&rsquo;s composition, &ldquo;Motivated Silence oc,&rdquo; he seeks to capture the sense of resilience and adaptability as the piece musically tells the story of leaving an unwelcome and abusive home. He was inspired to write this work from the deeply moving personal stories that have been shared with him and the strength he has seen from those whoâ€™ve faced being unhoused.
                <br><br>
                Dealing with the themes of life changes and challenges, Quadre reprises two works from its 4th album, <em>Our Time</em>, featuring the percussion talents of James Kassis. The spirited &ldquo;Mojo&rdquo; by recently retired Quadre member, Nathan Pawelek, highlights the emotions when faced with a midlife crisis. Let yourself go or dance your heart out. While Daniel Wood&rsquo;s song cycle without words, &ldquo;In Time&rdquo; chronicles the specific, yet familiar event in a life&mdash;the emotional undulations within a broken heart in the aftermath of a failed love.
                <br><br>
                The program is rounded out with the two winners of the 2020 International Quadre Composition Contest: Michael Kaulkin and Zachary McDonald. Among a competitive field of 69 composers, these works were chosen anonymously for their expert sense of craftsmanship and musicality. Kaulkin&rsquo;s &ldquo;By Hook or By Crook&rdquo; takes us on an emotional journey while McDonald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Locked Up&rdquo; captures the feelings of this past year when many of us were in isolation.
                <br><br>
                These works are augmented with artwork and poetry from Allied Artists West and Monday Night Poets. Poetry in a variety of forms was written by 7 poets specifically to accompany and enhance over 20 original pieces of art created by 17 artists in a range of mediums: oil, acrylic, watercolor, pastel, encaustic, collage, and even natural organic materials. And multimedia hip-hop producer Kristopher Grant lends his story-telling talents to create a vivid visual installation that further heightens the senses during our concert.

After his residency with Quadre in 1999&ndash;2000 in Alabama, Daniel&mdash;who founded the group&mdash;became deeply drawn to the issues of access to the arts, the environment, and society&rsquo;s insatiable consumption of products.

                    Daniel has performed with numerous chamber ensembles, opera and ballet companies, new music ensembles and orchestras.

                    In 2002, Daniel founded the digital arts program for the Community School of Music and Arts in Mountain View, CA where he also taught horn and music composition until 2013. Currently, he is the chair of musicianship and composition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Pre-College Division. He also maintains a private studio in his hometown of Mountain View, CA. Daniel received his BA in music from UCLA.

            <p>
                Kristopher Grant (Idea Unsound) is a classically-trained electronic music producer, mixing engineer, and Ableton Live instructor in San Francisco. He mixes clever melodies and conceptual ideas with elements of world, classical, and Hip-Hop to create a new and progressive electronic sound. He has been producing music for nearly 18 years and has both played and lectured internationally, being likened to &lsquo;a Bay Area version of Flying Lotus&rsquo; in a recent KQED Arts write-up. He has even recently co-founded an audio-based startup called Seeq Audio, which focuses on bringing intelligent multimedia audio solutions to media developers.
                <br><br>
                Unsound began his musical journey at a young age, getting involved with his middle school and elementary school orchestras. Growing up he learned to play viola in school and auto didactically learned the acoustic guitar. He started producing around the same time, getting a bootleg copy of FL studio 5 from a nearby friend and finding himself at home with the strange sounds the software created. From there he quickly expanded into using Propellerhead&rsquo;s Reason and experimenting more with sound design processes. Gradually, as his interest in production grew and grew, he became familiar with a whole host of audio processing paradigms (including the one presented by Ableton Live), and now he uses an assortment of audio-visual tools to create immense, audio-visual installations and performances with Ableton as the centerpiece.
                <br><br>
                Recently he has played alongside Suzanne Ciani, Sweaterbeats, XXYYXX, and Pat Lok among others, and has worked with the SF Ballet, Marin County Theater company, and a host of independent artists as a composer/ music producer. He has performed not only throughout the bay area, but was also invited to the international computer music conference in Shanghai, China, to perform new music and lecture about his use of Ableton Live in an audio-visual environment, seen by more than 500 international conference attendees. He has multiple releases available on every digital music platform and is signed to one of the leading global music distributors and creative platforms, AWAL.
