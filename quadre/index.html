            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Described as the ensemble that &quot;zaps the myth that classical stuff's stuffy&quot;, Quadre connects with their audiences everywhere, from concert halls and music festivals to soup kitchens and school auditoriums. With their vibrant music and artistic warmth, this innovative ensemble is well recognized not only for its virtuosic French horn mastery, but also for its humorous element of surprise. Their fresh and intellectually charming works make audiences resoundingly agree that experiencing a Quadre concert is a listening adventure not be missed as their music and message touches the heart and resonates deeply with the soul.
                <br><br>
                Selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and Chamber Music America as one of only a handful of chamber music ensembles for a rural residency, Quadre began its professional calling in Alabama in 1999. As musical ambassadors, Quadre traveled throughout the state, reaching citizens of all ages and backgrounds to make serious &quot;classical&quot; music accessible, meaningful and just plain fun. Following their successful immersion in Southern society and hospitality, the group returned to California to record the first of their four albums, titled The Voice of Four Horns.
                <br><br>
                In the course of releasing their subsequent three albums (Citrus, Our Time and Horns for the Holidays), Quadre actively commissions new works for the horn quartet genre. The ensemble draws on the compositional talents of members Nathan Pawelek and Daniel Wood as well as renowned composers David Garner, Mark Adam Watkins and Christopher Wiggins.

                        Quadre is equally dedicated to collaborating with other musicians, ensembles and composers to further the creation of innovative pieces, such as their work with Grammy award-winning flutist, Molly Barth; Los Angeles studio legend, James Thatcher; and Philadelphia phenom, soprano Elizabeth Weigle.
                        <br><br>
                        In over 1000 performances, Quadre has been featured as artists and lecturers with the Manhattan School of Music; Music Academy of the West; the 2008, 2011 and 2013 International Horn Conferences in California, Colorado and Tennessee respectively; and the Alabama Institute for Education in the Arts. Communities from Grand Forks, North Dakota to San Jose, California have invited Quadre to be concerto soloists. The group is honored to have performed for the Helen Keller School for the Deaf and Blind and the Weingarten Children's Center for the Deaf. In many ways, these experiences remind the ensemble how the connection to the arts is vital to everyone.
                        <br><br>
                        Quadre keenly embraces its leadership role as music ambassadors into the hearts of the communities where the ensemble performs and visits. Equally at home in schools, senior settings and universities, Quadre's interactive, interdisciplinary and lively community engagement programs have reached over 50,000 people across the United States. In 2000 and 2002, the San Francisco Symphony selected Quadre to participate in its unique educational outreach program, Adventures in Music. Performing for every 1st and 2nd grader in San Francisco, Quadre created engaging shows that captivated the young audiences from the start. The group creatively incorporates music, choreography and drama for wonderfully positive musical experiences that stimulate the senses and make lasting impressions upon audiences.

            <p>
                &quot;Wouldn't it be nice if&hellip;
                <br><br>
                &quot;As horn players and more fundamentally musicians, we want to succeed but are always running into the 'if' statements. If only I could clean up my lip trills&hellip; play the Reynold's etudes at tempo&hellip; play higher, faster, softer, smoother &ndash; I'd be something. I want to offer you an ensemble where you can discard the â€˜ifs' and let your true voice shine.&quot;
                <br><br>
                Daniel sent fifty letters with these words to horn players all across Los Angeles. Twenty replies were received and after a few weeks of rehearsals, four French horn players committed to establishing Quadre &ndash; The Voice of Four Horns.
                <br><br>
                From the start, Quadre's sound emanated from music and ideas beyond the traditional French horn experience. Our perpetually buoyant founder, Daniel, caught a bug when he watched in youthful awe, the off-beat musical &quot;Forever Plaid.&quot; That propelled him into the world of what he describes as &quot;solo boy bands&quot; (an oxymoron he explains &ndash; &quot;They were four guys in a band but together they created one singular voice, a singular vocal entity&quot;) of the 50s and 60s, like the Hi-Lo's and the Four Freshmen. With that, he was inspired to create music with a similarly unique &quot;solo band&quot; sound for the French horn. We are the Voice (not Voices) of Four Horns. Not a typo.
                <br><br>
                Within a year of our inception, our humble efforts resulted in a few videos, a demo recording, and to our excitement, a Chamber Music America grant with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts for a rural residency in Selma, Alabama. After our year long stay in the Heart of the South, we recorded our inaugural album, which captured our early sense of humor and earnestness to do something different.
            </p>

            <div class="fullimage" style="background-image: url('images/windowside.jpg')"></div>
            <p class="fullpanel">
                In the years that have followed, Quadre's sound and repertoire has evolved as has its membership. Everyone involved over the years (Eric, Melissa, Armando, Meredith, Alex, Carrie and others) has truly made Quadre what it is today. The percolating of ideas and concepts from so many gifted musicians solidified the group's sound, approach and character. Around 2008, everything finally clicked into place on a world-class level. Quadre's singular voice reached new heights with the members we have now.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 50px">
                Quadre's members are Amy Jo, Lydia, Nate and Daniel. Nate and his cerebral self-deprecating disposition. Lydia and her cool, sophisticated demeanor. Amy Jo and her grounded view of the world. And the driving force behind the group, Daniel and his quirky, yet passionate wit.
                <br><br>
                We continue to do what chamber groups do: record albums, tour, collaborate with other artists & ensembles, commission new work, and engage in educational and community programs. But what drives us onwards is our vision: to create and perform music as a means to enact transformable change.
                <br><br>
                We don't need to play at the most prestigious or biggest concert halls to accomplish this. We just need to touch one person at a time.

                <h2>Daniel Wood</h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplished performer, composer, and educator, Daniel founded Quadre in 1998. He is the executive director for the organization's nonprofit and handles all aspects of the business including marketing, development, and client engagement.
                    <br><br>
                    Compositionally, Daniel's works favor intimate groups &ndash; including brass, wind and string chamber music, steel drum ensembles and jazz combos. His pieces evoke a sense of time and place, leading listeners to reflect, cherish, and oftentimes, smile. Most notable commissions include &quot;Our Hot Date with Destiny&quot; for wind quintet from Avenue Winds; &quot;Space Available&quot; for horn duet from musicians of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; &quot;Shaking It Up&quot; for brass quintet from CSMA Brass; and &quot;Blinding Light&quot; from the Presidio String Trio. Daniel has also composed for all four of Quadre's albums, collaborating with guest horn player James Thatcher, Grammy award-winning flutist, Molly Barth, and soprano Elizabeth Weigle.
                    <br><br>
                    Daniel has performed with numerous chamber ensembles, opera and ballet companies, new music ensembles and orchestras including California, Oakland, Monterey, Napa, Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Fremont, and Vallejo Symphonies and Symphony Silicon Valley. He has toured extensively as a member of Quadre as well as the Mark GrowdenQuintet, Avenue Winds Quintet, and Teal Crane Trio.
                    <br><br>
                    A multi-faceted artist, Daniel has written and performed improvisational solo shows for the horn, piano, and electronics. After his nine month residency with Quadre in 1999-2000 in Alabama, Daniel became deeply drawn to the issues of access to the arts, the environment, and society's insatiable consumption of products. Examining the theme of music and diversity in the United States, Daniel premiered his show, &quot;Life on an Island,&quot; in 2007 and followed that success in 2009 with his show, &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime,&quot; a depression-era musical retrospective. More recently in 2012, Daniel's &quot;East meets West&quot; addressed international collaboration between American jazz artists and improvisatory Iranian Persian musicians, which played for a sold-out house at Berkeley's Ashkenaz.
                    <br><br>
                    Daniel has lectured widely on the Business of Music for the American Federation of Musicians, San Francisco Conservatory, Eastman School of Music, University of Oregon, and International Horn conferences. As a champion of new works, he founded and manages Solid Wood Publishing, a horn music publishing company with over 130 titles of horn music.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2002, he founded the digital arts program for the Community School of Music and Arts in Mountain View, CA where he also taught horn and music composition until 2013. Currently, he is the chair of musicianship and composition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Pre- College Division. He also maintains a private studio in his hometown of Mountain View, CA.
                    <br><br>
                    Daniel received his BA in music from UCLA with additional training in discipline-based arts education â€“ a Getty Center curriculum. When not delving into the latest musical project, he enjoys spending time with his wife and three kids (triplets) on hikes, bike rides and trips to the beach and beyond.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                Quadre's core mission to make music more accessible extends far beyond the concert hall. Equally at home in K-12 classrooms and colleges or universities, our interactive interdisciplinary outreach activities have reached over 50,000 people across the United States. Quadre's nationwide education residencies in urban and rural environments have been supported by funding from prominent organizations including, The National Endowment for the Arts, Chamber Music America, The San Francisco Symphony and The Arts Council of Silicon Valley.
                <br><br>
                Any aspect of the following educational initiatives can be combined to create a unique multi-day residency in your community or school.

                        We strive to serve the communities where we live and are dedicated to engagement with the community. We recognize that this need exists throughout the nation and seek to serve every community we visit in the same manner. The purpose of our engagement is to reach out to underserved populations and the community at large. Venues for such events inclue, but are not limited to: Title IV schools, hospitals, eldercare facilities, hospices, homes for troubled youth, prisons, shopping ceners, train stations, downtown areas and sporting venues.

                    <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
                        As our universal culture becomes more rich and diverse, we strive to make our presentations reflect the attitudes and desires of our listeners. Quadre believes that the creation and promotion of new music nurtures composers and opens the minds of young performers to new music that is essential to this cause. As we collaborate with artists of all disciplines, the synthesis of joint programs and presentations can add diversity to our own artistic expression and create new avenues to explore, which are vital to the artistic process.

                    Our Time, Quadre's newest CD release, explores the intricate human condition through relationships with time and change. The culmination of a two-year journey to commission new composers and to collaborate with non horn-playing instrumental artists, the pieces reflect on life's profound moments of love, longing, aging and awakening. Grammy Award winning flutist Molly Barth, percussionist James Kassis and soprano Elizabeth Weigle join Quadre on the CD performing new music by Brian Holmes, Nathan Pawelek, Mark Carlson, Daniel Wood and Jamie Keesecker.
