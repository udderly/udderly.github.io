                Described as the ensemble that &ldquo;zaps the myth that classical stuff&rsquo;s stuffy&rdquo;, Quadre connects with their audiences everywhere, from concert halls and music festivals to soup kitchens and school auditoriums. With their vibrant music and artistic warmth, this innovative ensemble is well recognized not only for its virtuosic French horn mastery, but also for its humorous element of surprise. Their fresh and intellectually charming works make audiences resoundingly agree that experiencing a Quadre concert is a listening adventure not be missed as their music and message touches the heart and resonates deeply with the soul.
                <br><br>
                Selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and Chamber Music America as one of only a handful of chamber music ensembles for a rural residency, Quadre began its professional calling in Alabama in 1999. As musical ambassadors, Quadre traveled throughout the state, reaching citizens of all ages and backgrounds to make serious &ldquo;classical&rdquo; music accessible, meaningful and just plain fun. Following their successful immersion in Southern society and hospitality, the group returned to California to record the first of their four albums, titled The Voice of Four Horns.
                <br><br>
                In the course of releasing their subsequent three albums (Citrus, Our Time and Horns for the Holidays), Quadre actively commissions new works for the horn quartet genre. The ensemble draws on the compositional talents of members Nathan Pawelek and Daniel Wood as well as renowned composers David Garner, Mark Adam Watkins and Christopher Wiggins.

                        Quadre is equally dedicated to collaborating with other musicians, ensembles and composers to further the creation of innovative pieces, such as their work with Grammy award-winning flutist, Molly Barth; Los Angeles studio legend, James Thatcher; and Philadelphia phenom, soprano Elizabeth Weigle.
                        <br><br>
                        In over 1000 performances, Quadre has been featured as artists and lecturers with the Manhattan School of Music; Music Academy of the West; the 2008, 2011 and 2013 International Horn Conferences in California, Colorado and Tennessee respectively; and the Alabama Institute for Education in the Arts. Communities from Grand Forks, North Dakota to San Jose, California have invited Quadre to be concerto soloists. The group is honored to have performed for the Helen Keller School for the Deaf and Blind and the Weingarten Children&rsquo;s Center for the Deaf. In many ways, these experiences remind the ensemble how the connection to the arts is vital to everyone.
                        <br><br>
                        Quadre keenly embraces its leadership role as music ambassadors into the hearts of the communities where the ensemble performs and visits. Equally at home in schools, senior settings and universities, Quadre&rsquo;s interactive, interdisciplinary and lively community engagement programs have reached over 50,000 people across the United States. In 2000 and 2002, the San Francisco Symphony selected Quadre to participate in its unique educational outreach program, Adventures in Music. Performing for every 1st and 2nd grader in San Francisco, Quadre created engaging shows that captivated the young audiences from the start. The group creatively incorporates music, choreography and drama for wonderfully positive musical experiences that stimulate the senses and make lasting impressions upon audiences.

                &ldquo;Wouldn’t it be nice if&hellip;
                <br><br>
                Daniel sent letters with these words to horn players all across Los Angeles. Twenty replies were received and after a few weeks of rehearsals, four French horn players committed to establishing Quadre &ndash; The Voice of Four Horns.
                <br><br>
                From the start, Quadre&rsquo;s sound emanated from music and ideas beyond the traditional French horn experience. Our perpetually buoyant founder, Daniel, caught a bug when he watched in youthful awe, the off-beat musical &ldquo;Forever Plaid.&rdquo; That propelled him into the world of what he describes as &ldquo;solo boy bands&rdquo; (an oxymoron he explains &ndash; &ldquo;They were four guys in a band but together they created one singular voice&rdquo;) of the 50s and 60s, like the Hi-Lo&rsquo;s and the Four Freshmen.

                Quadre&rsquo;s members are Amy Jo, Lydia, Nate and Daniel. Nate and his cerebral self-deprecating disposition. Lydia and her cool, sophisticated demeanor. Amy Jo and her grounded view of the world. And the driving force behind the group, Daniel and his quirky, yet passionate wit.

                We continue to do what chamber groups do: record albums, tour, collaborate with other artists &amp; ensembles, commission new work, and engage in educational and community programs. But what drives us onwards is our vision: to create and perform music as a means to enact transformable change.  We don’t need to play at the most prestigious or biggest concert halls to accomplish this. We just need to touch one person at a time.

                <p>
                    Nathan has worked with nationally-recognized artists, such as Aretha Franklin and Arlo Guthrie, and international stars: Gil Shahan, Joshua Bell, YoYo Ma, Midori, and Leonard Slatkin.

                <h2>Daniel Wood</h2>
                <p>
                    A multi-faceted artist, Daniel has written and performed improvisational solo shows for the horn, piano, and electronics.  After his residency with Quadre in 1999 &ndash; 2000 in Alabama, Daniel became deeply drawn to the issues of access to the arts, the environment, and society&rsquo;s insatiable consumption of products.  Examining the theme of music and diversity in the United States, Daniel premiered his show, &ldquo;Life on an Island,&rdquo; followed with his show, &ldquo;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime,&rdquo; a depression-era musical retrospective.  More recently, Daniel’s &ldquo;East meets West&rdquo; addressed international collaboration between American jazz artists and improvisatory Iranian Persian musicians.
                    <br><br>
                    Compositionally, Daniel&rsquo;s works favor intimate groups in the classical and jazz mediums. His pieces evoke a sense of time and place, leading listeners to reflect, cherish, and oftentimes, smile.  In addition to his many works for Quadre, notable commissions include &ldquo;Our Hot Date with Destiny&rdquo; for wind quintet from Avenue Winds, &ldquo;Space Available&rdquo; for horn duet from musicians of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and &ldquo;Blinding Light&rdquo; from the Presidio String Trio.
                    <br><br>
                    An engaging performer, composer, and educator, Daniel founded Quadre in 1998. He plays a Ricco-Kuhn horn.  When not delving into the latest musical project, he enjoys spending time with his wife and three kids on hikes, bike rides and trips to the beach and beyond.
