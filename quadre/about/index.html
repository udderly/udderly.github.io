            <p>
                With over two decades of experience performing throughout the United States, Quadre &ndash; The Voice of Four Horns was awarded the 2020 Heart Prize by the Ariel Avant organization in recognition of its artistic programming tied to social justice issues. The genesis of this life-changing artistic work came within the first two years of inception when the quartet was selected for a year-long rural residency program with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts and subsequently was granted two significant educational residencies by the San Francisco Symphony. The group has recorded four albums of contemporary and classical music that include commissions and collaborations with Grammy-award winning artists.
                <br><br>
                In over 1,000 concerts, from New York to California and North Dakota to Alabama, the ensemble has performed music that is acclaimed for moments of &ldquo;Inspiration, sorrow, love [and] virtuosic display&rdquo; (International Horn Call). Audiences, captivated by the richly distinctive, orchestral sound of four French horns playing in unison, find that a Quadre concert is a deeply moving experience.
                <br><br>
                The ensemble has collaborated with award-winning artists, including flutist, Molly Barth; Los Angeles studio legend, James Thatcher; and Philadelphia phenom, soprano Elizabeth Weigle. To further the creation of innovative pieces, Quadre has commissioned over 42 new works from renowned composers such as Nina Shekhar, Anthony Plog, Mark Adam Watkins and Christopher Wiggins, as well as drawing on the compositional talents of members Adam Unsworth and Daniel Wood.
                <br><br>
                Keenly embracing its leadership role as music ambassadors, Quadre has been honored to have performed for the Helen Keller School for the Deaf and Blind and the Weingarten Children&rsquo;s Center for the Deaf, and regularly performs at youth centers, soup kitchens and homeless shelters. Their civic outreach has touched local San Francisco Bay Area audiences at the Mountain View Centennial, extensions of the Steven Creek Trail, the Rengstorff House Arts Festival and performances at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. They have collaborated with local organizations including the Chamber of Commerce, Community Services Agency, and the Bill Wilson Center.
                <br><br>
                As teaching artists, Quadre has connected with over 50,000 students, seniors and adults throughout the United States. In their local community, they have performed for and worked with students at the Community School of Music and Arts, all of their city&rsquo;s public elementary, middle and high schools as well as students at the German International School, Girls Middle School, Waldorf School of the Peninsula, and St. Francis High School.
                <br><br>
                When not touring together, members of the ensemble perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and teach at the San Francisco Conservatory, University of Oregon and University of Michigan. As individuals, they received their training from Juilliard, Northwestern, UCLA and the Eastman School of Music.

Twice, the San Francisco Symphony selected Quadre to participate in its unique educational outreach program, Adventures in Music.
                        <br><br>
                        Most recently, Quadre captivated audiences with Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Konzertstuck,&rdquo; a concerto for four horns and orchestra and reunited with composer David Garner at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music to perform Cuadro Cuadrangulos, a work based on the Afro-Cuban rhythms son and rumba clave.

                    &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if&hellip;
                    <br><br>
                    &ldquo;As horn players and more fundamentally musicians, we want to succeed but are always running into the &ldquo;if&rdquo; statements. If only I could clean up my lip trills&hellip; play the Reynold&rsquo;s etudes at tempo&hellip; play higher, faster, softer, smoother &ndash; I&rsquo;d be something. I want to offer you an ensemble where you can discard the &lsquo;ifs&rsquo; and let your true voice shine.&rdquo;
                    <br><br>
                    Daniel sent fifty letters with these words to horn players all across Los Angeles. Twenty replies were received and after a few weeks of rehearsals, four French horn players committed to establishing Quadre &ndash; The Voice of Four Horns.
                    <br><br>
                    From the start, Quadre&rsquo;s sound emanated from music and ideas beyond the traditional French horn experience. Our perpetually buoyant founder, Daniel, caught a bug when he watched in youthful awe, the off-beat musical &ldquo;Forever Plaid.&rdquo; That propelled him into the world of what he describes as &ldquo;solo boy bands&rdquo; (an oxymoron he explains &ndash; &ldquo;They were four guys in a band but together they created one singular voice, a singular vocal entity&rdquo;) of the 50s and 60s, like the Hi-Lo&rsquo;s and the Four Freshmen. With that, he was inspired to create music with a similarly unique &ldquo;solo band&rdquo; sound for the French horn. We are the Voice (not Voices) of Four Horns. Not a typo.
                    <br><br>
                    Within a year of our inception, our humble efforts resulted in a few videos, a demo recording, and to our excitement, a Chamber Music America grant with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts for a rural residency in Selma, Alabama. After our year long stay in the Heart of the South, we recorded our inaugural album, which captured our early sense of humor and earnestness to do something different.
                    <br><br>
                    In the years that have followed, Quadre&rsquo;s sound and repertoire has evolved as has its membership. Everyone involved over the years (Eric, Melissa, Armando, Meredith, Alex, Carrie, Nathan and others) has truly made Quadre what it is today. The percolating of ideas and concepts from so many gifted musicians solidified the group&rsquo;s sound, approach and character. Around 2008, everything finally clicked into place on a world-class level. Quadre&rsquo;s singular voice reached new heights and continues to this day with the members we have now.
                    <br><br>
                    Quadre&rsquo;s members are Amy Jo, Lydia, Adam and Daniel. Adam and his calm, confident artistic perspective. Lydia and their cool, sophisticated demeanor. Amy Jo and her grounded view of the world. And the driving force behind the group, Daniel and his quirky, yet passionate wit.
                    <br><br>
                    We continue to do what chamber groups do: record albums, tour, collaborate with other artists &amp; ensembles, commission new work, and engage in educational and community programs. But what drives us onwards is our vision: to create and perform music as a means to enact transformable change. We don&rsquo;t need to play at the most prestigious or biggest concert halls to accomplish this. We&rsquo;ve each done that already. We just need to touch one person at a time.

                <h2>Daniel Wood</h2>
                <p>
                    A multi-faceted artist, Daniel has written and performed improvisational solo shows for the horn, piano, and electronics. After his residency with Quadre in 1999&ndash;2000 in Alabama, Daniel became deeply drawn to the issues of access to the arts, the environment, and society&rsquo;s insatiable consumption of products.
                    <br><br>
                    Compositionally, Daniel&rsquo;s works favor intimate groups in the classical and jazz mediums. His pieces evoke a sense of time and place, leading listeners to reflect, cherish, and often times, smile. He founded Solid Wood Publishing to showcase new works for horn.
                    <br><br>
                    Daniel has performed with numerous chamber ensembles, opera and ballet companies, new music ensembles and orchestras. He has toured extensively as a member of Quadre as well as with the Mark Growden Quintet, Avenue Winds Quintet, and Teal Crane Trio. He has lectured on the Business of Music for the American Federation of Musicians, San Francisco Conservatory, Eastman School of Music, University of Oregon, and International Horn conferences.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2002, Daniel founded the digital arts program for the Community School of Music and Arts in Mountain View, CA where he also taught horn and music composition until 2013. Currently, he is the chair of musicianship and composition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Pre-College Division. He also maintains a private studio in his hometown of Mountain View, CA. Daniel received his BA in music from UCLA.
                    <br><br>
                    When not delving into the latest musical project, Daniel enjoys spending time with his wife and three kids on hikes, bike rides and adventurous trips.
