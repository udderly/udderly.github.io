                Acclaimed for its virtuosic horn mastery, Quadre has dazzled audiences for decades with emotionally dynamic performances that transform listeners. A Quadre concert is an experience not to be missed.
                <br><br>
                The ensemble believes that every community, large or small, needs great art. To support this mission, Quadre engages audiences at all levels, with an innovative and immersive program that combines outreach, community events and concert hall performances.  By sharing its passion for music and social change, Quadre connects people and engenders local music sustainability.
                <br><br>
                Selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and Chamber Music America as one of only a handful of chamber music ensembles for a rural residency, Quadre began its professional calling in Alabama in 1999.   The ensemble has since collaborated with award-winning artists, including Grammy award-winning flutist, Molly Barth; Los Angeles studio legend, James Thatcher; and Philadelphia phenom, soprano Elizabeth Weigle. To further the creation of innovative pieces, Quadre has commissioned new works from renowned composers such as Mark Adam Watkins and Christopher Wiggins, as well as drawing on the compositional talents of members Nathan Pawelek and Daniel Wood.

                        Keenly embracing its leadership role as music ambassadors, Quadre has been honored to have performed for the Helen Keller School for the Deaf and Blind and the Weingarten Children’s Center for the Deaf, and regularly performs at youth centers, soup kitchens and homeless shelters.  Twice, the San Francisco Symphony selected Quadre to participate in its unique educational outreach program, Adventures in Music.
                        <br><br>
                        Most recently, Quadre captivated audiences with Schumann’s “Konzertstuck,” a concerto for four horns and orchestra, and in 2018, Quadre reunited with composer David Garner to (celebrate the 10th anniversary of its commission? Was there another purpose?) and to perform at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Cuadro Cuadrangulos, a work based on the Afro-Cuban rhythms son and rumba clave.

                &ldquo;Wouldn’t it be nice if&hellip;
                <br><br>
                Daniel sent letters with these words to horn players all across Los Angeles. Twenty replies were received and after a few weeks of rehearsals, four French horn players committed to establishing Quadre &ndash; The Voice of Four Horns.
                <br><br>
                From the start, Quadre&rsquo;s sound emanated from music and ideas beyond the traditional French horn experience. Our perpetually buoyant founder, Daniel, caught a bug when he watched in youthful awe, the off-beat musical &ldquo;Forever Plaid.&rdquo; That propelled him into the world of what he describes as &ldquo;solo boy bands&rdquo; (an oxymoron he explains &ndash; &ldquo;They were four guys in a band but together they created one singular voice&rdquo;) of the 50s and 60s, like the Hi-Lo&rsquo;s and the Four Freshmen.
                We continue to do what chamber groups do: record albums, tour, collaborate with other artists &amp; ensembles, commission new work, and engage in educational and community programs. But what drives us onwards is our vision: to create and perform music as a means to enact transformable change.  We don’t need to play at the most prestigious or biggest concert halls to accomplish this. We just need to touch one person at a time.

                <p>

                <h2>Daniel Wood</h2>
                <p>
                    A multi-faceted artist, Daniel has written and performed improvisational solo shows for the horn, piano, and electronics.  After his residency with Quadre in 1999 &ndash; 2000 in Alabama, Daniel became deeply drawn to the issues of access to the arts, the environment, and society&rsquo;s insatiable consumption of products.  Examining the theme of music and diversity in the United States, Daniel premiered his show, &ldquo;Life on an Island,&rdquo; followed with his show, &ldquo;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime,&rdquo; a depression-era musical retrospective.  More recently, Daniel’s &ldquo;East meets West&rdquo; addressed international collaboration between American jazz artists and improvisatory Iranian Persian musicians.
                    <br><br>
                    Compositionally, Daniel&rsquo;s works favor intimate groups in the classical and jazz mediums. His pieces evoke a sense of time and place, leading listeners to reflect, cherish, and oftentimes, smile.  In addition to his many works for Quadre, notable commissions include &ldquo;Our Hot Date with Destiny&rdquo; for wind quintet from Avenue Winds, &ldquo;Space Available&rdquo; for horn duet from musicians of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and &ldquo;Blinding Light&rdquo; from the Presidio String Trio.
                    <br><br>
                    An engaging performer, composer, and educator, Daniel founded Quadre in 1998. He plays a Ricco-Kuhn horn.  When not delving into the latest musical project, he enjoys spending time with his wife and three kids on hikes, bike rides and trips to the beach and beyond.
